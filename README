So, a friend of mine has a shipyard and he wanted an easy way to calculate
parking fees for boats. He bills his clients per meter per month and he wanted a
simple app that would:

a. given a starting date and an end date, calculate the number of months and
days in between
b. for that duration, calculate the fees that should be paid, according to a
given price.

The price can be given in one of three ways:
1. fees/month, directly
2. price/meter/month and also provide the boat length in meters
3. price/meter/month and also provide the boat length in feet

For now, all strings in the application's only window are in Greek. VAT is also
hardcoded to the current level in Greece, which is 23%.
